# Demo: Using Our Own Tools to Clean Up

We just demonstrated the full multi-agent workflow by using our own tools to organize the directory!

## What We Did

### 1. Started with scratchpad-multi.sh
```bash
./scratchpad-multi.sh --agent organizer start "Clean up llm-agent-tools directory"
```
- Tracked our progress through 4 steps
- Fixed a bug we discovered (AGENT_NAME_ typo)
- Archived the task when complete

### 2. Used codemap.sh for Documentation
```bash
./codemap.sh init                    # Initialize
./codemap.sh label ...              # Document each tool
./codemap.sh cheat multi-agent      # Created workflow cheatsheet
./codemap.sh debug "bug" "fix"      # Logged the bug we fixed
./codemap.sh summary                # Viewed overview
```

### 3. Leveraged knowledge.sh for Memory
```bash
./knowledge.sh --agent organizer store "tools.core" "..."
./knowledge.sh --agent organizer store "setup.command" "..."
./knowledge.sh --agent organizer share "tools.core"
./knowledge.sh --agent organizer share "setup.command"
```

### 4. Directory Organization
- Moved old scratchpad files to `memory-bank/shared/done_tasks/`
- All agent work contained in `memory-bank/`
- Clean separation of agent-specific vs shared resources

## Final Structure
```
memory-bank/
├── agents/organizer/        # Our agent's private workspace
├── codemap/                 # Code intelligence we created
│   ├── cheatsheets/        # Multi-agent workflow guide
│   ├── debug_history/      # Bug fix we logged
│   └── metadata/           # Tool descriptions
└── shared/                  # Shared resources
    ├── done_tasks/         # Archived tasks (including this demo)
    └── knowledge_base.json # Shared knowledge
```

## Key Insights from Demo

1. **Tools Work Together**: We used all three core tools in harmony
2. **Self-Documenting**: The tools help document themselves
3. **Clean Organization**: Everything stays within memory-bank/
4. **Bug Discovery**: Found and fixed a real bug during use
5. **Knowledge Persistence**: Information is preserved for future agents

This demonstrates that the tools are practical, self-contained, and genuinely useful for organizing work!
