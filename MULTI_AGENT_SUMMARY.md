# Multi-Agent Tools Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Fixed scratchpad.sh bug** - Corrected BANK_DIR initialization order (line 17-18)

2. **Created scratchpad-multi.sh** - Enhanced version with:
   - `--agent <name>` parameter for agent identification
   - Agent-specific scratchpads in `memory-bank/agents/<agent>/`
   - File locking for concurrent access
   - Task handoff capability between agents
   - `agents` command to list active agents

3. **Created knowledge.sh** - Lightweight knowledge base with:
   - Private agent knowledge storage (JSON)
   - Shared knowledge pool
   - Key-value storage with metadata (timestamps, tags, agent)
   - Search, sync, and export capabilities

4. **Created setup-multi-agent.sh** - Initializes directory structure

## Key Files

- `scratchpad.sh` - Original tool (bug fixed)
- `scratchpad-multi.sh` - Multi-agent enhanced version
- `knowledge.sh` - Agent knowledge management
- `codemap.sh` - Lightweight code intelligence (replaces architect.sh)
- `context.sh` - Context gathering tool
- `setup-multi-agent.sh` - Directory structure setup

## Directory Structure

All agent work is contained within the `memory-bank/` directory:

```
memory-bank/
├── agents/              # Per-agent private space
│   └── <agent>/
│       ├── scratchpad.md
│       └── knowledge.json
├── shared/              # Cross-agent shared resources
│   ├── done_tasks/      # Completed tasks archive
│   ├── handoffs/        # Task handoff records
│   └── knowledge_base.json
├── locks/               # Concurrency control
├── context/             # Active context gathering (context.sh)
├── context_archive/     # Archived context files
└── architecture/        # Architecture documentation (architect.sh)
    ├── modules/
    ├── decisions/
    └── flows/
```

**Important**: All tools now store their data within `memory-bank/` to keep the project directory clean and self-contained.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Make tools executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Initialize structure
./setup-multi-agent.sh

# Use tools with agent names
./scratchpad-multi.sh --agent researcher start "Research task"
./knowledge.sh --agent researcher store "api.key" "value"
./scratchpad-multi.sh --agent researcher handoff coder "Please implement"
```

## Implementation Approach

- Kept bash-only approach (with jq for knowledge.sh)
- Backward compatible - original tools still work
- File locking prevents concurrent write conflicts
- Agent isolation with shared resource access
- Simple handoff mechanism for task coordination
