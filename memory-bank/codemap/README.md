# Codemap - Lightweight Code Intelligence

This directory contains high-impact, low-overhead code intelligence for LLM agents.

## Structure

- `metadata/modules.json` - File labels, types, and dependencies
- `cheatsheets/` - Component quick references (public APIs, gotchas)
- `debug_history/` - Bugâ†’fix patterns for reuse

## Why This Matters

1. **Instant roadmap**: Agents know where things are without searching
2. **Fewer hallucinations**: Cheatsheets prevent wrong API usage
3. **Learn from history**: Debug logs prevent repeating old mistakes
